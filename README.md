# Dog-vs-Cat-prediction

Widely popular Dog vs Cat dataset with the help of Ktrain !!!!!

ktrain is a lightweight wrapper for the deep learning library Keras (and other libraries) to help build, train, and deploy neural networks. 

1.utilize learning rate schedules such as the triangular policy, the 1cycle policy, and SGDR to effectively minimize loss and improve generalization.

2.estimate an optimal learning rate for your model given your data using a Learning Rate Finder
